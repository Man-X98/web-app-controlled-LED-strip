This is the code for the web app. To use the web app make sure you download the whole web app folder and place it on your raspberry.
Dont change up the structure of the folder.

I recommend setting up a fixed IP for the raspberry. 
Otherwise your router might assign a new IP to your raspberry and the NodeMCU can no longer get the required information from it.

If your router supports it, this can easily be done with the web interface of your router. Just look for something like DHCP reservation and enter the needed infromation
